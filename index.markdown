<h1>Observing Heat Islands</h1>
<h2>LST Map Outputs</h2>
<h3>Portland (City) - Scappoose (Suburb)</h3>

To account for climate and weather conditions, we considered Portland, as well as its suburb Scappoose as a baseline value to get insights about LST dynamics.

The Following map shows for each Pixel within our box that covers Portland the difference to the yearly average of Scappoose from the year 2013 to 2018.

Additionally, in the following graph we can observe the average values for each month from the year 2013 to 2018.

<h2>Investigating Example Point Dynamics</h2>
In the following section, we are observing the average LST of three example points within Portland. The following three exammple points are observed:

The points show an interesting dynamic. In the following two charts, first the LST of the three example points over time are shown, then the difference between those point averages and the Scappoose values are displayed.
